1. Overview
   ---

This project demonstrates practical detection engineering for Windows environments using Splunk. The detections are mapped to MITRE ATT&CK techniques and built as modular SPL queries and XML dashboards so they can be imported into a Splunk app or used standalone.

Business value: Reduce dwell time by surfacing suspicious authentication patterns, credential dumping, obfuscated PowerShell usage, remote file downloads, and lateral movement indicators.

2. Key features (what recruiters care about)
   ---

 MITRE ATT&CK mapping for each detection (clear tactic & technique).

 Modular SPL files per detection so reviewers can run just one query.

 Dashboards & visualizations showing detection counts, trending, and affected hosts.

 Saved searches & alert examples for operationalizing detections.

 Testing instructions and sample logs to validate results.

 Clear README + demo screenshots so a recruiter can quickly understand scope and impact.

5. Install & run (step-by-step)
   ---

Prerequisites: Splunk Enterprise 8.x+, access to Windows Security logs indexed into Splunk.

Clone repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/tuh1n-bd/RealWorld-Threat-Detection-and-Hunting-mitre_attack.git
```

cd RealWorld-Threat-Detection-and-Hunting-mitre_attack

Import the dashboard XML files into Splunk (Settings ‚Üí Dashboards ‚Üí Import).

Copy queries/*.spl contents into new saved searches or run them manually to validate.

Tune thresholds and time windows in savedsearches.conf.example (below) to minimize false positives.

6. Importing dashboards & saved searches (examples)
   --

savedsearches.conf.example ‚Äî create this under $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/YourApp/local/savedsearches.conf

[Detect_Brute_Force_1.2]
search = index="sim1" sourcetype="cvs" EventID=4625 | stats count by Source_IP, Account_Name | where count >= 5
cron_schedule = */5 * * * *
disabled = 0
alert.severity = 3
alert.suppress = 0
alert.track = 1
[Detect_PowerShell_Base64_1.19]
search = index="sim1" sourcetype="cvs" CommandLine="*powershell*" (CommandLine="*-enc*" OR CommandLine="*-encodedCommand*") | table _time Account_Name ComputerName CommandLine
cron_schedule = */10 * * * *
disabled = 0
alert.severity = 4

Note: These are examples ‚Äî tune where thresholds and cron_schedule for your environment.

7. Alert & priority guidance (how to tune)

High severity: Credential dumping (mimikatz), encoded payload execution, suspicious account privilege escalation.

Medium severity: Multiple failed logons, RDP logons from atypical geolocations.

Low severity: Single whoami commands, 1‚Äì2 failed attempts.

Suggested workflow: Have high severity trigger immediate analyst notification; medium queue for triage; low for hunting dashboards.


## Sample Detection Description




 Detection 1.1 ‚Äî Successful Logon Event Tracking
MITRE Technique: [T1078] Valid Accounts (Track successful logons using EventID
4624 )
---
Explanation:
‚Ä¢	EventID=4624: Indicates a successful logon.
‚Ä¢	LogonType: Identifies how the user logged on (e.g., RDP, local, network).
‚Ä¢	This is useful to baseline normal login behavior.

spl:
```
index="sim1" sourcetype="cvs" source="SecurityLogs_MITRE_Advanced_sample.csv" EventID=4624
| stats count by Account_Name, ComputerName, Source_IP, LogonType
| sort - count
```

<img width="1203" height="711" alt="mitre7" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b4270732-6107-41f8-97c2-0fd49ebacc6b" />

 Detection 1.2 ‚Äì Multiple Failed Logon Attempts by Single Source IP
MITRE Technique: [T1110] Brute Force
Goal: Detect brute-force attacks from a single source IP attempting multiple logins.
 ----
 
 Explanation
‚Ä¢	EventID=4625: This represents failed logon attempts in Windows security logs.
‚Ä¢	Source_IP and Account_Name: Grouped to identify if a single IP is trying many different or same usernames.
‚Ä¢	count >= 5: Threshold to flag potential brute force.
‚Ä¢	Use Case: An attacker may guess passwords by repeatedly trying logins ‚Äî this identifies such patterns.
spl:
```
index="sim1" sourcetype="cvs" source="SecurityLogs_MITRE_Advanced_sample.csv"
EventID=4625
| stats count by Source_IP, Account_Name
| where count >= 5
| sort - count
```

üîπ Detection 1.3 ‚Äî Successful Logon After Multiple Failures
MITRE Technique: [T1110] Brute Force ‚Üí Credential Access
Goal: Detect cases where a user had multiple failed logon attempts followed by a successful one ‚Äî indicating possible password guessing success.
--

Explanation:
‚Ä¢	EventID 4625: Failed logon attempt.
‚Ä¢	EventID 4624: Successful logon.
‚Ä¢	We group events by Account_Name and Source_IP to correlate activity.
‚Ä¢	Logic:
o	If a user has ‚â•3 failed attempts (4625) followed by at least 1 success (4624), it's highly suspicious.
‚Ä¢	Use Case: Brute-force password guessing that eventually succeeds.

spl:
```
index="sim1" sourcetype="cvs" source="SecurityLogs_MITRE_Advanced_sample.csv"
(EventID=4625 OR EventID=4624)
| stats values(EventID) as event_list count(eval(EventID=4625)) as failed_attempts,
        count(eval(EventID=4624)) as success_count by Account_Name, Source_IP
| where failed_attempts >= 3 AND success_count >= 1
```

<img width="1209" height="700" alt="mitre2" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/88a432b1-c4d8-44d4-a954-6ab6f9906aec" />

 Detection 1.4 ‚Äî Privileged Logon Detection
MITRE Technique: [T1078.002] Valid Accounts: Domain Accounts
Goal: Detect logon events where privileged (admin-level) accounts are used ‚Äî especially if unexpected.
---
 Explanation
‚Ä¢	EventID 4624: Successful logon.
‚Ä¢	ElevatedPrivileges="Yes": Indicates admin-level privileges were used.
‚Ä¢	LogonType:
o	Type 2 = Interactive (local)
o	Type 3 = Network
o	Type 10 = Remote (RDP)
Logic: We want to catch high-privilege accounts logging into systems, especially if the account is not commonly used or seen before.

spl:
```
index="sim1" sourcetype="cvs" source="SecurityLogs_MITRE_Advanced_sample.csv"
EventID=4624 AND ElevatedPrivileges="Yes"
| stats count by Account_Name, Source_IP, ComputerName, LogonType
```

üîπ Detection 1.5 ‚Äî Rare User Logon Detection
MITRE Technique: [T1078] Valid Accounts
Goal: Identify user accounts that log in very rarely, which could indicate account compromise, misuse, or initial foothold.
----

üîç Explanation
‚Ä¢	EventID 4624 = successful logon events.
‚Ä¢	stats count by Account_Name = total number of logons per user.
‚Ä¢	eventstats avg(count) = calculate average logons across all users.
‚Ä¢	where count < avg_logons = show users logging in less than average.
‚Ä¢	Assumption: Rare logons might indicate newly active accounts used by attackers (e.g., old unused or service accounts).

spl:
```
index="sim1" sourcetype="cvs" source="SecurityLogs_MITRE_Advanced_sample.csv" EventID=4624
| stats count by Account_Name
| eventstats avg(count) as avg_logons
| where count < avg_logons
| sort count
```

üîπ Detection 1.7 ‚Äî Multiple Failed Logons Followed by Success
MITRE ATT&CK Technique: [T1110] Brute Force
Objective: Detect brute force attempts ‚Äî several failed login attempts followed closely by a successful login from the same IP and user.
---

 Explanation Breakdown
‚Ä¢	EventID=4625: Failed logon
‚Ä¢	EventID=4624: Successful logon
‚Ä¢	stats values(EventID): Collects both successful and failed attempts
‚Ä¢	failed_count >= 3: Looks for 3+ failed attempts
‚Ä¢	last_event = 4624: Indicates a successful login happened at the end, which can suggest a brute-force success.

spl:
```
index="sim1" sourcetype="cvs" source="SecurityLogs_MITRE_Advanced_sample.csv" (EventID=4625 OR EventID=4624)
| stats values(EventID) as event_list count(eval(EventID=4625)) as failed_count latest(EventID) as last_event by Account_Name, Source_IP
| where failed_count >= 3 AND last_event=4624
