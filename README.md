Welcome to the **RealWorld Threat Detection and Hunting** repository, focused on advanced Splunk SPL queries and dashboards designed to detect and investigate real-world cyber attack scenarios mapped to the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Overview

This repository contains a collection of Splunk detection queries created to identify attacker techniques and suspicious behaviors within Windows environments. The detections are aligned with MITRE ATT&CK tactics and techniques, providing security analysts with effective tools for threat hunting and incident investigation.

The following detection queries have been successfully tested and are included:
1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 1.5, 1.7, 1.9, 1.11, 1.12, 1.13, 1.14, 1.16, 1.19, 1.26, 1.27, 1.28, 1.33, 1.35, 1.37, 1.40, 1.41, 1.47, 1.50


- **queries/** — Contains individual SPL queries for each detection use case.
- **dashboards/** — Contains Splunk dashboard XML files for visualization.

## Sample Detection Description
🔹  Detection 1.1 — Successful Logon Event Tracking
MITRE Technique: [T1078] Valid Accounts (Track successful logons using EventID
4624 )

Explanation:
•	EventID=4624: Indicates a successful logon.
•	LogonType: Identifies how the user logged on (e.g., RDP, local, network).
•	This is useful to baseline normal login behavior.

```spl
index="sim1" sourcetype="cvs" source="SecurityLogs_MITRE_Advanced_sample.csv" EventID=4624
| stats count by Account_Name, ComputerName, Source_IP, LogonType
| sort - count

🔹  Detection 1.2 – Multiple Failed Logon Attempts by Single Source IP
MITRE Technique: [T1110] Brute Force
Goal: Detect brute-force attacks from a single source IP attempting multiple logins.
 
🔍 Explanation
•	EventID=4625: This represents failed logon attempts in Windows security logs.
•	Source_IP and Account_Name: Grouped to identify if a single IP is trying many different or same usernames.
•	count >= 5: Threshold to flag potential brute force.
•	Use Case: An attacker may guess passwords by repeatedly trying logins — this identifies such patterns.

index="sim1" sourcetype="cvs" source="SecurityLogs_MITRE_Advanced_sample.csv"
EventID=4625
| stats count by Source_IP, Account_Name
| where count >= 5
| sort - count

🔹 Detection 1.3 — Successful Logon After Multiple Failures
MITRE Technique: [T1110] Brute Force → Credential Access
Goal: Detect cases where a user had multiple failed logon attempts followed by a successful one — indicating possible password guessing success.
🔍 Explanation
•	EventID 4625: Failed logon attempt.
•	EventID 4624: Successful logon.
•	We group events by Account_Name and Source_IP to correlate activity.
•	Logic:
o	If a user has ≥3 failed attempts (4625) followed by at least 1 success (4624), it's highly suspicious.
•	Use Case: Brute-force password guessing that eventually succeeds.

index="sim1" sourcetype="cvs" source="SecurityLogs_MITRE_Advanced_sample.csv"
(EventID=4625 OR EventID=4624)
| stats values(EventID) as event_list count(eval(EventID=4625)) as failed_attempts,
        count(eval(EventID=4624)) as success_count by Account_Name, Source_IP
| where failed_attempts >= 3 AND success_count >= 1

🔹 Detection 1.4 — Privileged Logon Detection
MITRE Technique: [T1078.002] Valid Accounts: Domain Accounts
Goal: Detect logon events where privileged (admin-level) accounts are used — especially if unexpected.
🔍 Explanation
•	EventID 4624: Successful logon.
•	ElevatedPrivileges="Yes": Indicates admin-level privileges were used.
•	LogonType:
o	Type 2 = Interactive (local)
o	Type 3 = Network
o	Type 10 = Remote (RDP)
Logic: We want to catch high-privilege accounts logging into systems, especially if the account is not commonly used or seen before.

index="sim1" sourcetype="cvs" source="SecurityLogs_MITRE_Advanced_sample.csv"
EventID=4624 AND ElevatedPrivileges="Yes"
| stats count by Account_Name, Source_IP, ComputerName, LogonType

🔹 Detection 1.5 — Rare User Logon Detection
MITRE Technique: [T1078] Valid Accounts
Goal: Identify user accounts that log in very rarely, which could indicate account compromise, misuse, or initial foothold.

🔍 Explanation
•	EventID 4624 = successful logon events.
•	stats count by Account_Name = total number of logons per user.
•	eventstats avg(count) = calculate average logons across all users.
•	where count < avg_logons = show users logging in less than average.
•	Assumption: Rare logons might indicate newly active accounts used by attackers (e.g., old unused or service accounts).

index="sim1" sourcetype="cvs" source="SecurityLogs_MITRE_Advanced_sample.csv" EventID=4624
| stats count by Account_Name
| eventstats avg(count) as avg_logons
| where count < avg_logons
| sort count

🔹 Detection 1.7 — Multiple Failed Logons Followed by Success
MITRE ATT&CK Technique: [T1110] Brute Force
Objective: Detect brute force attempts — several failed login attempts followed closely by a successful login from the same IP and user.

🔍 Explanation Breakdown
•	EventID=4625: Failed logon
•	EventID=4624: Successful logon
•	stats values(EventID): Collects both successful and failed attempts
•	failed_count >= 3: Looks for 3+ failed attempts
•	last_event = 4624: Indicates a successful login happened at the end, which can suggest a brute-force success.

index="sim1" sourcetype="cvs" source="SecurityLogs_MITRE_Advanced_sample.csv" (EventID=4625 OR EventID=4624)
| stats values(EventID) as event_list count(eval(EventID=4625)) as failed_count latest(EventID) as last_event by Account_Name, Source_IP
| where failed_count >= 3 AND last_event=4624

🔸 Detection 1.9 — Logon from Multiple Locations by Same User
📖 MITRE ATT&CK Mapping
•	Technique: T1078 – Valid Accounts
•	Tactic: Credential Access / Defense Evasion

stats dc(Source_IP)	Counts distinct IPs per user
values(Source_IP)	Lists the IPs each user logged in from
BY Account_Name	Groups the stats per user
where unique_ips > 1	Filters for users who logged in from more than one IP
sort - unique_ips	Sorts users by highest number of IPs used
